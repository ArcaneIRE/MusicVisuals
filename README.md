# Music Visualiser Project

Collaborators: David Corcoran (D22126022) & Kai Reid (C21745961)

## Description of the assignment

This group project involved using creative coding skills to create an abstract visual story of a chosen song. The project required analyzing the audio of the song and using its main characteristics, such as frequency and volume, to generate a visually compelling and abstract representation of the song's mood, tempo, and structure.

Color, shape, motion, and composition should be used to effectively convey the song's emotions, themes, and structure through the interplay of visual elements. The final program is presented in a YouTube video highlighting its key features and functionality.
