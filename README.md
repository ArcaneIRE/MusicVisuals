# Music Visualiser Project

## Description of the assignment

This group project involved using creative coding skills to create an abstract visual story of a chosen song. We analysed the audio of our song of choice, [Primavera](https://open.spotify.com/track/4BMHp3DkI8VLsuB9Kr0pzu?si=140ff2c011254c8b) by Ludovico Einaudi and attempted to create a visually compelling, abstract representation of the song's mood, structure and theme.

This was accomplished using [Processsing](https://processing.org/) and its associated [Minim](https://code.compartmental.net/minim/) audio library.

## Installation / How to Run

1. Ensure you have [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/ie/java/technologies/downloads/) or newer installed
2. Ensure VSCode and the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) are installed
3. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository to your local machine
4. Navigate to the [Main](java\src\ie\tudublin\Main.java) file in the ie/tudublin package and press `ctrl+f5` to run, or use the "Run Java" play button in the top right

## How it works

The layers of land are generated randomly using Perlin noise on each run, and filled in with trees according to the current intensity of song.

## What I am most proud of in the assignment

Initially we planned to create a typical EDM visualiser, however we were unable to agree on a song that we felt we could create realise in a unique way. [Primavera](https://open.spotify.com/track/4BMHp3DkI8VLsuB9Kr0pzu?si=140ff2c011254c8b) appealed to both of us. Meaning "sprintime" in Italian, it inspired us to create a landscape that grows and becomes more complex alongside the music.

I am happy with the humble justice we were able to do to the theme and structure of such a grand and moving piece of music. The gently faded layers and small scale trees create a sense of scale. The slow transition from empty landscape to brimming forest fits the theme of springtime and the rise/build up of the song.

The sunset mirrors the anticipation before the crescendo, where the visualisation turns from slow bloom to excited apex.
